# Galaxy Playlist Generator

## Project Overview 

This repository contains a JavaScript project that generates personalized "Awesome Mix" playlists for each of the Guardians of the Galaxy. The playlists are tailored based on the musical preferences of each Guardian. The project involves manipulating arrays and objects, using the map() function for data transformation, and dynamically updating the DOM based on the generated playlists.

## Getting Started

+ Clone the repository to a local development environment.
+ Open the project in a preferred code editor.
+ Modify the songs array and the guardians object as per the provided instructions.
+ Implement the generatePlaylist function to create personalized playlists for each Guardian.
+ Test the application to ensure correct filtering of songs by genre for each + Guardian and the display of the playlists on the web page.

## Instructions

1. **Expand the Songs Array**: Add at least five songs to the `songs` array, each with `title`, `artist`, and `genre`.
2. **Assign Preferences**: Complete the `guardians` object by assigning each Guardian their preferred music genre.
3. **Generate Playlists**: Implement the `generatePlaylist` function. Use the `map()` function to create a personalized playlist for each Guardian based on their genre preference.
4. **Display Playlists**: Dynamically create and append elements to the `#playlists` div to display each Guardian's playlist. Include the Guardian's name and their list of songs.
5. **Test Your Application**: Ensure that the application correctly filters songs by genre for each Guardian and displays the playlists on the web page.

## Learning Outcome

+ **Manipulating Arrays and Objects:** Develop a strong understanding of working with JavaScript arrays and objects. This includes adding, modifying, and accessing data within arrays and objects.

+ **Applying the map() Function:** Learn how to use the map() function in JavaScript to transform data within an array. This will enable to create personalized playlists based on specific criteria.

+ **Dynamic DOM Manipulation:** By dynamically creating and appending elements to the DOM, this will enhance skills in updating web pages with dynamic content based on data.

+ **Testing and Debugging:** Gained experience in testing and debugging JavaScript code to ensure that the application correctly filters songs by genre for each Guardian and displays the playlists on the web page.

+ **Project Documentation:** Writing a README file for the project helped  understand the importance of providing clear and comprehensive instructions for other developers who may want to use or contribute to a project.
